# Shauns QoL (Quality of Life)
A Minecraft mod to teach myself Minecraft modding *again* because of the major changes since 1.12. I figured others could benefit from this as well. So here you go!

This mod is meant to serve as a 'repository' for reusable code for other mods. I have a long list of things I want to implement but don't know if they will ever see the light of day.
